# Credit Card Anomaly Detection 🚀  

## Why I Built This 🏗️  
The idea for this project came from my interest in fraud detection and the growing need for secure financial transactions. With online payments becoming the norm, fraudsters are finding smarter ways to exploit vulnerabilities. I wanted to explore how machine learning can help detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy while minimizing false positives.  

## What This Project Does 🎯  
This project applies anomaly detection techniques to credit card transactions to identify suspicious activities. The aim is to build a reliable system that flags potentially fraudulent transactions based on patterns and statistical anomalies.  

## How I Built It ⚙️  
The process involved several steps:  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extracting meaningful features to improve model accuracy.  
3. **Model Selection** – Experimenting with different anomaly detection algorithms.  
4. **Evaluation & Optimization** – Fine-tuning the model to balance precision and recall.  
5. **Visualization** – Creating insights from the results for better interpretability.  

## Tech Stack 🛠️  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## How to Run It 🔥  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-anomaly-detection.git
   ```  
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow along with the code.  

## Lessons Learned 📚  
While working on this project, I learned a lot about handling imbalanced datasets, selecting the right evaluation metrics for fraud detection, and optimizing machine learning models to reduce false alarms. It also deepened my understanding of real-world applications of data analytics.  

## What's Next? 🚀  
I plan to improve the detection accuracy by integrating deep learning techniques and testing the model on real-time streaming data.
